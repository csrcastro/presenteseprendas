// This is called a "splat route" and as it's in the root `/app/routes/`

// can know that the user is hitting a URL that doesn't exist. By throwing a
// 404 from the loader, we can force the error boundary to render which will
// ensure the user gets the right status code and we can display a nicer error
// message for them than the Remix and/or browser default.
